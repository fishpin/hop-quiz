Hop Quiz!

Hop Quiz is a beginner-friendly JavaScript project built to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic state management. The quiz presents multiple-choice questions, lets the user submit answers, and provides immediate correct or incorrect feedback before moving on to the next question. I also used this project as an opportunity to experiment with neumorphic design philosophies and further my CSS knowledge.
